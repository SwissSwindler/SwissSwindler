- Hello, I'm SwissSwindler.
- I’m incredibly interested in learning a vast variety of coding languages, along with finding informative individuals along the way
- Currently I'm becoming better-adapted in the Linux (Ubunto) OS, along with polishing my abilities in Javascriot, Python, HTML, and CSS.
- I’d be best-suited to work on projects incorperating web-development, though I could certainly learn additional languages if need be. 
-  You can contact me via Gmail or Discord.
